Here we have to design a datastore assuming the service had 100 API's and there are 1000 users roughly making 1 million requests per day.

Average response time = Total time taken to respond during the selected time period/no.of responses in selected time period.

Following are key Response time testing example values

Response 
Time	       Significance
0.1 Second  If the response time is 0.1, users always feel that the application or system is responding instantly, and do not feel any interruption.
1.0 Second	It is the defined as the maximum limit of acceptable response time. Users are unlikely to feel any interruption, though they may experience some delay. 
10 Seconds	It is a maximum limit after which response time goes beyond the acceptable limit.

Use the following formula to determine Tresponse, the response time (in seconds) at peak load:

Tresponse = n/r - Tthink

where

n is the number of concurrent users

r is the number requests per second the server receives

Tthink is the average think time (in seconds)
